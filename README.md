### Music Recommender System
**Repository:** https://github.com/damladmrk/music_recommender

A probabilistic and algorithmic music recommendation system designed to analyze user preferences and generate personalized recommendations. 

**Focus areas:**
- Bayesian reasoning and probability-based decision making  
- Feature analysis and similarity metrics  
- Algorithmic recommendation logic  
- Clean and modular software design  

This project emphasizes interpretability and structured reasoning over black-box approaches. We reached this as a project of the class Probability and Statistics.

### 🧬 Genetic Algorithms
**Repository:** https://github.com/damladmrk/GeneticAlgorithms

An implementation of optimization algorithms inspired by natural selection and evolutionary processes.

**Focus areas:**
- Search and optimization under constraints  
- Fitness functions and selection strategies  
- Mutation and crossover mechanisms  
- Performance evaluation of heuristic methods  

This project reflects my interest in human nature implemented with our tools.

### Student Assistant
**Computer Science - Discreathe Math for Comp. Eng.**

Worked as a student assistant, supporting academic and technical activities within the department.

**Responsibilities:**
- Assisting with coursework and technical problem-solving  
- Supporting students with programming and conceptual questions  
- Developing course metarials
- Giving and evaluating homeworks and exams  

This role improved my communication skills and reinforced my understanding of core computer science concepts.

## Working Style

- I approach problems by first understanding constraints and failure cases.
- I prefer to visualize the problems in my head and support with theoritical thinking.
- I value clarity, productivity, and group learning.
- I am comfortable working both independently and within structured teams.
